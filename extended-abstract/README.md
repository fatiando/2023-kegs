## Summary

<!-- brief description of what the talk will be about -->

## Introduction

<!-- something about geosciences and open source, the history and the need to
develop os tool for a more collaborative and reproducible science -->

The relation between geophysical research and computational solutions dates
back to the very origins of the latter. Scientists and industry saw in
computational power a mean to solve new challenging problems within geosciences
and exploration. They offer the possibility to process large amount of data,
generate visualizations for interpretation and ultimately to perform inversions
to build models of the subsurface.

Companies and researchers started developing their own software to
perform tasks likes these. Even most of them built in-house tools, the
appearance of open-source software for geosciences happened as early as
computer started to being use in this field. Projects like Seismic Unix
[@seismicunix]

## Theory and/or Method

<!-- Name this section "The project". -->
<!-- Describe the libraries in the project and their capabilities. -->

## Examples (Optional)

<!-- provide some simple examples with code snippets? -->
<!-- maybe within the description of each library? -->

## Conclusions

<!-- How fatiando allowed a global community of collaborators to work together in -->
<!-- an open-source project. -->
<!-- Who are using fatiando and their achievements. -->
<!-- Future goals? -->

## Acknowledgements (Optional)

<!-- OSS community and fatiando contributors and users. -->
