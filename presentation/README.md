## Ideas

- Introduce Fatiando
    - Little bit of history
    - Leo in Brazil
    - I joined (somewhere in 2016)
    - started as a single Python library
        - show some small examples? like the growing inversion gif? (maybe not
          gifs??)
    - Now it's formed by a collection of Python libraries
    - Extend the open-source python ecosystem
    - Community and contributors from all around the world (picture of them)
- Show examples
    - Gravity processing of south africa data
    - Grid transformations? osbourne mine? Erie lake mag survey?
    - Other utilities?
        - open oasis montaj grids. download one from NRCAN (Erie lake mag
          survey)
        - Plot 3d model of the topography when doing topographic correction?
- Invite people:
    - Link to the website
    - Contact me (EOAS email?)
    - Handles


Slides ideas:

1. Cover
1. Introduce myself. finish with Fatiando a Terra
1. Presenting today Fatiando a Terra (project image with link to website)
1. A little bit of history.
1. Started as a single Python library in South America, as part of PhD thesis
   of Leonardo Uieda. (image of the old fatiando package?)
1. Evolved into its current shape: a collection of Python libraries for
   geosciences.
1. Introduce each library with its main features.
1. Examples. Show the snippets and figures for the south africa gravity
   processing example.
1. More examples. Show how to apply transformations to grids?
1. More useful tools.
    * Load oasis montaj grd file downloaded from NRCAN
    * Plot 3D model of the topography?
1. Who are we? Community of users and developers. (maybe leave this for the
   end?)
