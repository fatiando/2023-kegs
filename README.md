# Fatiando a Terra: Open-source tools for geophysics

## Abstract

<!-- a little about the project -->

The Fatiando a Terra project (https://www.fatiando.org) is a collection of
open-source Python libraries for geophysics which cover a range of
functionalities, from data download and processing to modelling and inversion.

The history of this project started in 2010 in South America as a simple Python
library as part of a PhD Thesis. Over time, Fatiando a Terra grew and the team
of developers matured and established best practices for maintaining software
projects in the open. At the same time, a community began to form around this
project to encourage the development of the project, and contributors from
around the world started getting involved through active participation.

Since 2018, the code base has been restructured in order to obtain a better
infrastructure with the emerging geophysical ecosystem. It was split in smaller
libraries, each one with a specific set of goals and scope of applications.
Currently the project host libraries like Verde, for data processing and
interpolations; Pooch, for data downloading and caching; Boule, for managing
reference ellipsoids and compute normal gravity; Harmonica, processing and
modelling gravity and magnetics; and Ensaio that allows to download a set of
curated open datasets to teach and practice.

The project is notable for meeting the highest standards in software
development. Through the application of best practices and a thoughtful design
of its tools, it provides well tested and well documented code that is easy to
use, regardless of the Python skills of its users.
The high quality of these Python libraries allows other projects and scientists
to rely on them as part as their own code, to conduct their research and also
to develop new methodologies based on these tools.

The high quality of the development process allows to create robust Python
libraries that other projects can rely on

All the effort of producing high quality Python libraries pays off at lowering
the learning

- standards
    - Well designed code that's easy to use
    - Simple design
    - Well documented
    - Well tested
    - Incentivise good practices

<!-- What do we want to tell? -->

- live coding? no... probably we are not going to be able to do that
- geophysics oriented. what can we do with our tools?
